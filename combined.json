Thai exporters still have to face with the impact of duty fluctuations each year as duties are adjusted on an annual basis.  - The ranking in the Trafficking in Persons Report is another measure of the United States that has a significant impact on the country's reputation.

Each country continued to ease its monetary policy to sustain economic growth. The Federal Reserve Bank cut interest rates three times. The Bank of Thailand cut interest rates two times. These factors resulted in fluctuation of Thai Baht exchange rates and Thai Baht appreciation against the US Dollar. In the meantime, from the beginning of the year, funding costs in financial markets had been dropped gradually. Therefore, the Company has considered the appropriateness of the management of exchange rates and interest rates since the majority of the Companys revenue was in foreign currencies, including revenue from overseas businesses, revenue from export of goods of businesses in Thailand, as well as dividends from investment, etc. In addition to its revenue, the Company also had its expenditure in foreign currencies incurred from the purchasing of raw materials, import of supplies, machines and equipments, including expenditure for foreign investment while some parts of loans were in foreign currencies. Thus, the Company needed to manage its revenue and expenditure properly, including managing the cost of borrowing to reduce the above-mentioned impacts. In 2019, CPF and its subsidiaries in Thailand had the total value of export of goods, amounted to Baht 32,056 million or equal to 6% of the total sales revenue, and had the value of import of raw materials amounted to Baht 22,276 million or equal to 5% of the total cost of sale. Regarding the management of interest burden, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had the net debt-to-equity ratio/16 of 1.33 times; whereas, in the total amount of debts, some parts thereof were incurred from the borrowing from financial institutions and issuing of financial instruments, all of which resulted in expenses in a form of an interest expense. It was predicted that the interest rates would continue to fluctuate according to the global economic conditions and the economy of Thailand. Therefore, the Company has to consider funding alternatives, compensation payout patterns or periods required for funding in order to manage interest expense at a proper level and in accordance with the Companys policy.",

Such event did affect the goods distribution in a wide range. Moreover, the Covid19 situation in Thailand affects our production plant due to the restriction on number of people in-out, social distancing requirement. Accordingly, after the adjustment to the government measures and regulation which were clearly shown during the third quarter accumulated the outcome of the Company\u2019s turnover. \nThe Company conducted as assessment on marketing situation and suspension on certain marketing activities in response to the sale volume proportion determined. Despite of the online sale channels, the border closure in come counties affected the goods distribution to consumers, dramatically delaying the product circulation. Furthermore, China imposed the strict regulations to control marketing activities of all brands to ease the product persuasion. For example, prohibition on voting based on purchase value to win the prize limited the opportunity to boost the sales. Both the brand and consumers faced difficulty in reaching each other. All these contributed as a great challenge in China. Nonetheless, the Company has adjusted and planned to cope with the fluctuating situation. In 2021, more products were released, for example, Tempura Seaweed, Roasted Seaweed, more flavours were also added in response to consumers\u2019 feedback. After the data research made from consumers to identity behavior and their attitude toward our brand and products, the consumers of Taokaenoi product and not, well recognized the brand identity \u201cchild in red\u201d, and not mistake with other brands. Such positive response indicated good sign for Taokaenoi brand recognition. \nConsumers also saw the importance of reaching Taokaenoi products and required better distribution of products to a wider scope. Such demonstrated a good signal from consumers to our products. Since Taokaenoi product distribution has not been well distributed to consumers in previous years, the Company sees the importance to enhance the product distribution to reach consumers at a wider scope. In 2022, we expected to see the variation during the first half upon the consistent alignment between the product and sale channel to stimulate the reach to product and marketing activity and to create the recognition at the extensive range simultaneously. \nIn addition to the COVID-19 spreading crisis, the Company also faced the container shortage during the fourth quarter when the freight cost increased significantly. Despite of the FOB, where buyer is responsible for goods transportation, the increase of freight cost gave the Company higher cost as well. However, such did not affect selling prices for consumers. \nTo summarise the Chinese marketing, the year 2021 still be the year where we managed to cope with different changes.

Separate from this, the Company\u2019s key trading partners have issued continuous measures to manage this problem. For instance, there are measures from the EU and USA to make Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and policies to import goods free of deforestation or biodiversity risk from Europe. These measures are considered to be trade barriers. At the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), each country submitted a national plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which may have the result of additional measures of this type. Hence, sales, profit, or market share may be reduced.

The Russia-Ukraine war is a conflict which has impacted the Company\u2019s business, as these countries are globally important exporters of grain and natural gas, impacting raw materials for producing food in the supply chain. For instance, the price of wheat increased because Ukraine could not export it, while energy increased in price from the boycott of energy produced by Russia. There were shortages of palm oil, which reached a high price because it was being used as a substitute for sunflower seeds and sunflower oil which Ukraine could not export. Also, Indonesia, a major exporter of palm oil, suspended exports temporarily. Fertilizer increased in price because Russia and China limited exports. The costs of growing vegetables and other crops increased as a result. Apart from the war between Russia and Ukraine, these crises and uncertainties caused the government of each country to issue special measures to reduce possible impacts. Such measures included the temporary suspension of exports, price interventions on agricultural crops, or in the foreign exchange markets. Whatever the conflict, there were inevitable impacts to the Company\u2019s management of the supply chain, as the Company had production bases, used raw materials and sold products all over the world. It was therefore impacted by both volumes and price of raw materials, requiring management of the situation to enable the business to continue production and sales according to sales and profit targets.

NSL is moreover confident in the expertise and capabilities of NSL in food business and cost management flexibility, which together will contribute to the agreements and further renewal of the MoU. While there is no sign that CPALL will not renew the MoU, NSL envisions that should the MoU have not been renewed, NSL would still be able to manufacture products for CPALL on a non-exclusive basis, where NSL must develop its products to compete with other producers. Additionally, NSL also possesses the ability to manufacture products for customers other than CPALL if those products are NSL\u2019s marketing properties and not covered under the MoU. Nevertheless, the non-renewal of MoU would have consideble impact on NSL\u2019s business operations, decreasing sales revenue comparing to that recorded under the MoU.",

Therefore, if the exchange rate in Thai baht to US dollar fluctuates significantly, it may affect the company\u2019s performance."

Significant investments have been made in research and development to enhance existing products, develop new products, and invest in production technology and research and development (R&D), with a particular focus on innovating unique palatant. However, in case of unexpected events or the impossibility of responding to expectations, satisfaction, and customer needs on time, the potential impact may diminish competitiveness and affect the growth rate of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company also relies on research and development teams, including the Global PetCare Innovation (GPCI) team, comprised of animal nutrition specialists, food scientists, product technology specialists, and veterinarian. The competition for personnel with such specialized skills in the labor market is intense. If the Company is unable to retain these skilled professionals, there is a risk of potential delays in the completion of our research and development projects."

In the contract manufacturing business, the Company faces competition from other pet food manufacturers, both in Thailand and abroad. The intensified competition within the pet food industry can be attributed to the growing number of pet food products and the entry of new manufacturers and distributors. The Company anticipates that competition in the pet food industry will continue.\nMoreover, other manufacturers or distributors may attempt to gain market share by lowering prices which could impact the Company\u2019s competitiveness with other operators in the market."

                        "Risk Topic": "Rising raw material costs, mainly fish and chicken, could significantly impact the Company\u2019s operating results. Generally, the Company purchases local seafood directly from local fishery suppliers while Thai Union\u2019s purchasing team procures imported Tuna and seafood for the Company. Purchase orders are issued directly to the suppliers. For the purchase of raw chicken materials, the Company directly procures from domestic chicken meat suppliers at negotiated prices. Prices of such raw materials may fluctuate based on market conditions, and the volatility depends on factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as global demand and supply of raw materials. In 2023, the price of tuna, one of our main raw materials, increased by 7.8 percent from 2022 while price of chicken decreased by 4.1 percent from 2022.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires well-organized production and logistic plans. In case the Company faces challenges in procuring sufficient raw materials, it could potentially impact the timely delivery of the goods leading to consequences, such as strained customer relations, increased shipping costs, or the loss of sales opportunities. To ensure on-schedule product delivery to customers, the Company needs to maintain sufficient inventory, especially raw materials sourced from international suppliers. This involves a continuous evaluation of inventory quantities and estimated customer orders."
